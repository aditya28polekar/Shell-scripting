    <h1>Shell Scripting Learning (Part 1)</h1>

    <h2>1. How to create a file?</h2>
    <p>To create a file in Linux, you can use the <code>touch</code> command. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code>touch filename.txt</code></pre>

    <h2>2. Difference between ksh, bash, and echo command in Linux</h2>
    <p><strong>ksh</strong>: Refers to the KornShell, which is a Unix shell that is backward-compatible with the Bourne
        shell (sh).</p>
    <p><strong>bash</strong>: Refers to the Bourne-Again Shell, the most common shell used in Linux, offering advanced
        features and improved scripting capabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>echo</strong>: A command used to display text or variables on the terminal.</p>

    <h2>3. How to list files and folders?</h2>
    <p>To list files and folders in Linux, you can use the <code>ls</code> command. Here are some examples:</p>
    <pre><code># List files and folders in the current directory
ls

# List files and folders with detailed information
ls -l

# List all files and folders, including hidden ones
ls -a

# List files and folders sorted by modification time
ls -lt</code></pre>

    <h2>4. <code>man</code> command in Linux</h2>
    <p>The <code>man</code> command is used to display the manual pages for various commands and system functions in
        Linux. It provides detailed information, usage examples, and command options. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code>man ls</code></pre>

    <h2>5. How to write a file in Linux using <code>vi/vim</code></h2>
    <p>To write a file in Linux using the <code>vi</code> or <code>vim</code> text editor, follow these steps:</p>
    <pre><code># Open the file in the vi editor
vi filename.txt

# Press 'i' to enter insert mode and start writing
This is some text.

# Press 'Esc' to exit insert mode
# Type ':wq' to save and exit the file
:wq</code></pre>

    <h2>6. Difference between <code>touch</code> and <code>vim</code></h2>
    <p><code>touch</code> is used to update the access and modification timestamps of a file or create an empty file if
        it doesn't exist. <code>vim</code> is a powerful text editor that allows you to create, edit, and modify files.
    </p>

    <h2>7. How to copy content in Linux?</h2>
    <p>To copy content in Linux, you can use the <code>cp</code> command. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code># Copy a file
cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt

# Copy a directory and its contents recursively
cp -r source_directory/ destination_directory/</code></pre>

    <h2>8. Purpose of <code>#!/bin/bash</code> or <code>#!/bin/sh</code> in a script</h2>
    <p>The <code>#!/bin/bash</code> or <code>#!/bin/sh</code> line, also known as a shebang, specifies the interpreter
        (shell) that should be used to execute the script. In this case, <code>/bin/bash</code> or <code>/bin/sh</code>
        is the path to the Bash or Bourne shell executable, respectively.</p>

    <h2>9. How to use the <code>insert</code> command in Linux?</h2>
    <p>The <code>insert</code> command is not a standard Linux command. If you meant the insert mode in text editors
        like <code>vi</code> or <code>vim</code>, you can enter insert mode by pressing the 'i' key. In insert mode, you
        can type and edit text. Press 'Esc' to exit insert mode.</p>

    <h2>10. How to execute a Shell Script?</h2>
    <p>To execute a shell script in Linux, follow these steps:</p>
    <pre><code># Make the script executable (if it's not already)
chmod +x script.sh

# Run the script
./script.sh</code></pre>

    <h2>11. How to grant permissions in Linux? <code>chmod</code> command and how to use it?</h2>
    <p>The <code>chmod</code> command is used to change permissions (read, write, execute) of files and directories in
        Linux. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code># Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the owner
chmod u+rwx filename.txt

# Grant read and execute permissions to the group
chmod g+rx filename.txt

# Grant read permissions to others
chmod o+r filename.txt</code></pre>

    <h2>12. How to check the history of commands?</h2>
    <p>To check the history of commands executed in a shell session, you can use the <code>history</code> command.
        Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code>history</code></pre>

    <h2>13. How to create folders?</h2>
    <p>To create folders (directories) in Linux, you can use the <code>mkdir</code> command. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code>mkdir foldername</code></pre>

    <h2>14. How to change the directory in Linux?</h2>
    <p>To change the current working directory in Linux, you can use the <code>cd</code> command. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code>cd /path/to/directory</code></pre>

    <h2>15. How to write a simple shell script?</h2>
    <p>To write a simple shell script, create a new file with a <code>.sh</code> extension and add your commands to it.
        Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# This is a simple shell script
echo "Hello, World!"</code></pre>

    <h2>16. What is the purpose of Shell Scripting in DevOps?</h2>
    <p>Shell scripting plays a vital role in DevOps by automating repetitive tasks, facilitating system administration,
        and enabling the deployment and management of applications. It allows for the orchestration of various DevOps
        processes, such as provisioning infrastructure, configuring environments, deploying applications, and managing
        system resources.</p>

    <h2>17. How to check CPU and RAM of a Linux Machine?</h2>
    <p>To check CPU and RAM information in Linux, you can use various commands:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>top</code>: Provides real-time information about CPU usage, memory usage, and other system statistics.
        </li>
        <li><code>htop</code>: Similar to <code>top</code>, but with an interactive and user-friendly interface.</li>
        <li><code>free</code>: Displays information about memory usage and available memory.</li>
        <li><code>cat /proc/cpuinfo</code>: Shows detailed information about the CPU(s) in the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>18. What is the "top" command and why is it used?</h2>
    <p>The <code>top</code> command is used to monitor system resources in real-time, providing a dynamic view of
        processes, CPU usage, memory usage, and other system statistics. It is commonly used for performance monitoring,
        troubleshooting, and identifying resource-intensive processes.</p>

    <h2>19. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks, managing systems, and enabling DevOps practices. It
        allows you to create scripts to perform repetitive tasks, manipulate files and directories, manage permissions,
        and interact with system resources. Learning shell scripting can greatly enhance your efficiency and
        productivity as a Linux user or a DevOps practitioner.</p>
